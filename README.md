## Sorting Algorithms Time Complexity Testing Application


### **About The Project**

This is a Java application built as part of a larger algorithms analysis project which I completed for the HDip in Software Development. The aim of the project was to analyse the theoretical space and time complexity of various searching and sorting algorithms compared to the measured performance of these algorithms when tested on various data sets. The purpose of the Java application is to record the runtime taken by a set of sorting algorithm when given various sets of unsorted data.


### **Project Details**
- Application generates random integer arrays ranging from size n 100 â€“ 10,000
- Application tests runtime of sorting algorithms : Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Counting Sort, Bubble Sort, Quicksort
- Application Runs Tests 100 Times and Calculates Average Test Time Results
- Application Displays Results In A Formatted Table Printed To Console

### **Running Details**
- Main method is contained in AlgorithmsTest.java

### **Built With**
- Java
- Eclipse
